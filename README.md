# About
Trumpet is designed for visualization of quality assessment of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing data. Trumpet package takes the aligned BAM files from m6A-seq data together with transcriptome information as the inputs to generate a quality assessment report in HTML format, which covers a number of metrics that are relevant to the m6A-seq technique.
